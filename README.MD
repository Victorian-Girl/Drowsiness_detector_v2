A part of this projet was made during my course.


I have modified some part to include a alarm and red colors on the screen to wake up the user.


You will need 2 alarms song of your choice and put it into a folder name "Ressources" in the same repository of your project.
One for the fist warning and the second for the wake-up warning

 audio1 == fist warning alarm song,
 audio2 == wake-up warning alarm
